            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelors in Health Science and a specialty in Emergency and Critical Care. I really enjoyed working with my teams to provide the best possible care for patients. Along the way, I found that I had a strong desire to create projects of my own, whether it be documentation using spreadsheets, using functions to dynamically engage with numbers, etc.</p>
            <!--  A description that shows your passion for webdevelopment and your willingness to work with others-->
            <p>I was initially drawn to the problem solving aspect of coding, and I found that I enjoyed creating small projects using code that I've created. I'm very excited to be a student at Thinkful, where I can be attain the skills and knowledge to become a software developer. </p>
            <!-- 1-2 sentences that dsescribe other interests you have outside of web development. -->
            <p>In my free time, I like to play games, browse memes, and take naps. My 3 favorite games are: </p>
